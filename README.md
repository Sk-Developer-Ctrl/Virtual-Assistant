### Creating a Virtual Assistant with JavaScript

This project is a simple **virtual assistant** built using JavaScript, designed to interact with users and respond to commands. The virtual assistant leverages JavaScript's ability to process user input, provide responses, and execute certain tasks in a browser environment. The goal of this project is to create an engaging interface that simulates basic conversational AI and automates common tasks like searching the web, setting reminders, or retrieving data.

#### Features:
- **Voice and Text Input**: The assistant can process user input in the form of text, and with Web Speech API, can also accept voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Uses JavaScript’s Web Speech API to convert speech responses into Speech Reply.
- **Command Handling**: Processes user commands like asking for the weather, opening web pages, or providing information from APIs.
- **Interactive UI**: The assistant interacts with users through a simple, user-friendly interface.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to add more features or integrate with external APIs.

#### Technologies:
- **HTML/CSS**: Used to create the front-end structure and style for user interaction.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core logic for processing commands, interacting with APIs, and generating responses.
- **Web Speech API**: Implements voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities.

This project can serve as a foundation for further AI-based assistants or as an educational tool to learn more about JavaScript’s interaction with web-based APIs.
